"hello world"
hello_world = "hello"
puts hello_world
#so the error text that is written when i start to write this is:
#expected no Exception, got #<NameError: undefined local variable or method `hello_world' for main:Object> with backtrace
#the error is written down, a #<NameError. it's because a variable has not been defined.
